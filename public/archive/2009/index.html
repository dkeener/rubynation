      <h2>Training Day Was Awesome</h2>
	
	  <p>Thanks CodesSherpas for a great Training Day! The level of the content fit the group perfectly, and there was a lot of good practical advice in there. All of the details were handled well, and everything was very organized. We will definitely do this again next year.</p>

      <h2>Happy Hour Added (Not)</h2>
	
	  <p>2ND UPDATE:  Sorry, we tried.  There is just no way to do the happy hour now and keep things in the black. Too many other expenses to do it, and no way to do it while making sure to keep the cost for it down.

<p>
UPDATE:  Dang. Maybe we got ahead of ourselves here. There is now an issue with the hotel that might eat up the Happy Hour money.  Sorry folks, I need to check with them tomorrow to see what happened.  So, we need to wait another day before confirming the happy hour.  As I've said before Hotel food is the most expensive food on the planet, and drinks are even worse.

<p>
We had a happy hour last year that was awesome.  So, we are doing that again.  Open bar and finger food, cheeses and crackers.  Just light food, because people will want to go out to the Town Center restaurants to eat.  The happy hour will be from 6-7 on Friday night.

<p>
The move to the new main room puts us next to the patio with a private hallway.  It seemed like a sign that we need to do the happy hour again, so we are!</p>

      <h2>Sold Out, But Not Sold Out!</h2>
	
	  <p>Bad news and good news.  We sold out, which is normally bad news for people trying to get tickets.  But, the hotel switched us to a larger room today.  So, I added 10 more tickets.  Good news after all.  We are sold out, but not sold out!  We will keep the 10 tickets available until at least Tuesday afternoon when we need to get the final count to the hotel.

<p>
This puts us over the limit on our original contract with the hotel, which means that they are now charging us more per person, so I have removed all of the discount codes to partly compensate.</p>

      <h2>Give a Lightning Talk!</h2>
	
	  <p><p>The RubyNation wants to hear your lightning talk! Whatever you want to talk, rave, or rant about, this is your chance. We don't care what it is, just as long as it is of interest to the Ruby community and relatively short (like 10 minutes max). Your lightning talk can be fun, like "X is awesome! It changed me as a person!", a call to arms, like "Help us build Y. The world needs it!", a plea, like "Let's put an end to the scourge of Z.". You've heard of opinionated software, well this is opinionated talking. So, let's hear yours. Oh, and please keep it no worse than PG-13 rated.
</p>

<p>
We will have two sessions devoted to lightning talks, so your chances of getting heard are good.
</p>

<p>
You can register your lightning talk at the conference when you check in (or anytime really, at our front desk).  But if you know what it is now, let us know now, so we can start the list (we already know of three of them). Send your talk description to 'proposals at rubynation.org' with the following information:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Your name
</li>
<li>
Presentation title and short description

      <h2>Announcing Chad Fowler as the Keynote presenting "The Passionate Programmer"</h2>
	
	  <p>RubyNation is proud to announce our friend Chad Fowler as our 2009 Keynote presenter.  Chad will explain how you can become "The Passionate Programmer".

<p>
What should the career path of a programmer be? How do you know what you're aiming for? What defines success?

<p>
Many of us started out assuming the answers to these questions included slowly climbing a corporate promotion structure, ultimately becoming a people or project manager and no longer a programmer.

<p>
But we didn't get into software development so we could fill out spreadsheets and attend status meetings. We got into software development because we were excited about it. We wanted to be creative and to build great things.

<p>
From the author of The Passionate Programmer, this session will walk through how a software developer can not only succeed but work toward building a remarkable career. We'll draw examples from business, the arts, music, and sports. By the end of the presentation, we will have laid out a structured framework for radically succeeding in the software industry. </p>

RubyNation is happy to announce Bruce Tate presenting "Requires SEO; acts_up".

<p>
Rails has great tools for building highly interactive excellent web applications quickly. Some of these very tools, including complex routes with flexible URL parameters, remote JavaScript, and navigation strategies can hurt you big time in search engines. In this talk, Bruce Tate talks about the experience he gained in building three commercial web applications and the lessons learned with each. Some of the topics include
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Working with faceted navigation and SEO.
</li>
<li>
Building smart URLS
</li>
<li>
Using redirects to control duplicate content
</li>
<li>
Remote JavaScript and SEO
</li>
</ul>

<p>
After the talk, you should have a clearer understanding of how to use the tools at your disposal to build sites that will have a stronger SEO footprint.
</p>

<p>
Bruce Tate is a mountain biker, kayaker, and father of two from Austin, Tx. The Chief Technologist for WellGood, LLC, Bruce uses Ruby technologies to build web sites that make a difference. ChangingThePresent is a marketplace for donation gifts and ClassWish, to be launched this Fall, is a site that will help teachers raise money for items that they would normally pay for out of their own pocket. Bruce is the author of more than ten books, including Beyond Java, From Java to Ruby, Rails Up and Running, and a co-author of Deploying Rails applications.

RubyNation is pleased to announce speaker Mark Cornick who will present "Code Stinkers Anonymous: Learning To Write Better Code And Love Refactoring".
<p>
As a professional developer, especially one who works in Ruby, you hear about code quality all the time. You learn that testing your code and making it easy to maintain are the path to success. You know about TDD, BDD, TATFT and LMNOP. You learn to cycle from red to green to refactoring. We all do our best to write quality, maintainable, reusable code. We're all human, though; some of us slip, and some of us have had to work hard at preventing code smells. In this talk, Mark will discuss how he learned to program, how going pro exposed flaws in his coding style, and how he is working to improve his code's quality, sharing some of his old stinky code, the better, refactored versions, and the lessons he has learned in honing his craft.
<p>
Mark Cornick is a web developer and systems administrator at Viget Labs in Falls Church, Virginia. He spent the first ten years of his career doing sysadmin work, until he learned Ruby and Rails as a way to stay busy during a layoff. Seeing that development was much more mentally stimulating than sysadmin, he switched career paths and has been doing Ruby development full-time since 2007.</p>

<p>
As Phil Karlton said, “there are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.” Despite enormous advances in the field of web development over the last five years, it remains difficult to use caching to allow sites to scale for expanding user bases. Fortunately, the last few years have also seen the rise of JavaScript libraries that take a lot of the pain out of client-side programming. In David's talk, he’ll explore techniques for making your sites feel faster, without resorting to complicated caching schemes, while maintaining strict separation of content, style, and behavior.

<p>
The goal is that the talk will serve three purposes: to explain some of the psychology behind user impressions of website performance, to introduce unobtrusive javascript to the uninitiated, and to describe some novel techniques to more experienced web developers.

<p>
David is a web developer at Viget Labs, building web applications for companies ranging from startups to established brands, as well as internal and open source projects. After several years as a PHP developer, he made the switch to Ruby in 2006 and hasn’t looked back. He specializes in Ruby on Rails, jQuery, and RESTful web services. A Washington, DC native, David now lives and works in Durham, NC.</p>

RubyNation is happy to announce Hal Fulton presenting "Reia: The Next Big Thing?".

<p>
Reia is a language still in its infancy but showing great promise. It borrows heavily from Ruby, as well as from Python and Erlang. Some are speculating that the marriage of object-oriented and functional programming may be the next incremental leap in our thinking. Here I'll examine the benefits that Erlang has and how Reia tries to bring these to a language with Ruby-like syntax and semantics.

<p>
Hal Fulton is a developer for Collective Media, working from home in Austin, Texas. He has two degrees in computer science and has been using Ruby since 1999. He is the author of The Ruby Way, now in its second edition.</p>

RubyNation is pleased to announce speaker David Keener presenting "Creating A World-Class RESTful Web Services API".

<p>
Companies like Amazon, Google and Yahoo have published web services API's that empower developers to create mash-ups, add-ons and full-scale applications. The creation of such API's, however, is not exclusively the domain of large, multi-national corporations. Learn how to architect, build and field a well-designed and scalable RESTful web services API that will allow your business to leverage the capabilities of the developer community. This presentation includes real-life examples from the Grab Networks RESTful API, which provides access to information about the hundreds of thousands of news videos available through Grab Networks' distribution network. 

<p>
David Keener is a writer and technical architect with over 20 years of experience; he blogs regularly at KeenerTech.com. He is a technical architect for Grab Networks, the company known for streaming the Beijing Olympics over the web and for distributing more news videos in the US than any other company except MSNBC. </p>

RubyNation welcomes David Medinets, who will present a talk on ActiveScaffold.  

<p>
ActiveScaffold is a tool that produces on-the-fly scaffolding that looks much better than the default Rails scaffolding. It uses Ajax to create, update, and delete without page reloads. Also, the scaffold is nearly totally customizable in well-documented ways. In this presentation, David will show how to use ActiveScaffold to produce a custom user interface while still letting the tool do the hard work of generating forms.

<p>
David Medinets has been programming since 1980, starting with a TRS-80 Model 1. He still fondly remembers the days when he could cross-wire the keyboard to create funny-looking characters on the display. Since those days, he has written three books teaching the Perl, PHP, and BASH languages. David is a SCRUM Master and expert application developer specializing in Ruby and Java. He is knowledgeable about the business domains of Insurance, Supply Chain, and Airline Inventory. </p>

RubyNation welcomes Yehuda Katz presenting "From Rails to Rack: Making Rails 3 a Better Ruby Citizen".

<p>
Rails 3 is on its way, and Yehuda Katz is giving RubyNation a sneak peek! With the advent of the Rack spec and library, Ruby web frameworks can interact in unprecedented ways. Imagine a Rails application routing to a Sinatra application, or Merb-style exception pages that catch exceptions from Rails or Cloudkit.

<p>
The idea is simple: create a tiny API for interaction between elements of a web application. Instead of requiring special mechanisms for tests, controller instantiation, or CSRF forgery protection, design apps as a collection of such elements strung together into a stack. As with Unix pipes, limiting the interaction between elements makes powerful combinations a snap.

<p>
Merb 0.9 was rebuilt from the ground up to take advantage of Rack, and Rails has begun incorporating it as well. Rails 3 will make Rack a fundamental part of the framework.

<p>
Join Yehuda and talk about how this powerful idea is influencing the next generation of Rails, and how it will change the way you develop.

<p>
Yehuda Katz works full time at Engine Yard as a Core Team Member on the Rails and Merb projects. He is the co-author of jQuery in Action and the upcoming Merb in Action, and is a contributor to Ruby in Practice. He spends most of his time hacking on Rails and Merb, but also on other Ruby community projects, like Rubinius and Datamapper. And when the solution doesn't yet exist, he'll try his hand at creating one - as such, he's also created projects like Thor and DO.rb. </p>

      <h2>David A. Black provides a tour of Ruby 1.9.</h2>

RubyNation is very pleased to announce David A. Black, who will provide a tour of Ruby 1.9. 

<p>
With the release of Ruby 1.9.1 in January, the 1.9 series has really come into its own. There are a lot of new features, as well as some snags for anyone migrating code from 1.8. In this presentation, we'll look at a bit of both: what's new in 1.9 (encoding, the full maturity of enumerators, sorted hashes, and more) and some of the things you need to be aware of as you update your existing code (no more "each" for strings, the remove of the default to_a, etc.) The talk will give you your bearings in 1.9, preparing you to get the most out of the language and helping you to follow the on-going debates and discussions about the further development of Ruby.

<p>
David A. Black is a well-known and highly-regarded Ruby and Rails programmer, author, and trainer. Active in the Ruby world since 2000, David has more than a decade of full-time teaching experience, and is the author of Ruby for Rails: Ruby techniques for Rails developers (Manning Publications, 2006) and Rails Routing (Addison-Wesley, 2007). He has been interviewed for InfoQ and the Rails Podcast; has co-organized numerous Ruby/Rails conferences; and has spoken at conferences and Ruby/Rails users groups in the United States, Canada, and England. </p>

      <h2>Tony Pitale presents "'Handling' Legacy Databases with Rails and DataMapper".</h2>

RubyNation is pleased to announce Tony Pitale who will present "'Handling' Legacy Databases with Rails and DataMapper".

<p>
DataMapper has pushed the Ruby ORM market to new heights of speed (through laziness), strength (through separation), and flexibility (through mapping). At this time the rails_datamapper plugin is the way to bring DM and Rails together. Soon, the Merb/Rails merger will lead to seamless inter-operability between DM and Rails.

<p>
In the coming years we can only expect to deal with more and more legacy databases, whether they come from the corporate Java projects or from aging PHP web applications.

<p>
The goal of this session is to provide some strategies for “handling” legacy databases, for whatever that means to a project. Whether it be using the database as is, wrapping it nicely, or simply migrating into a better designed and built database. We’ll begin by covering the basics of setting up DM in Rails. We’ll quickly move on to cover, at the very least, overriding keys of varying types, non-standard table naming, connecting to multiple databases for the purpose of syncing or migrating data, and a variety of association examples. If time permits we’ll discuss methods of addressing constraints, triggers, views, and database functions.

<p>
Tony Pitale is a developer at Viget Labs, where he builds Rails applications for startups and conventional businesses. He’s been developing with Ruby for nearly 3 years and has built web applications with Rails, Merb, and DataMapper. When not developing he spends time with his girlfriend, dog, and family, as well as reading, writing, cycling, and playing jazz music. </p>

RubyNation is please to announce Pradeep Elankumaran will present "Fast and Scalable Front/Back-end Services using Ruby, Rails and XMPP".

<p>
The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a set of open standards for real-time presence and communication that has been powering high-traffic instant messaging systems for close to a decade. Apart from instant messaging, it is now possible to write web applications that leverage the power of XMPP's message delivery mechanisms to provide superior user interfaces and backend architectures. This session will provide an overview of the XMPP protocol, examples of scalable architectures and introduces libraries to interface Ruby web frameworks with XMPP. 

<p>
A former computational scientist, Pradeep was writing astrophysical simulations in Ruby well before the language became fashionable. Since then, he has been working with and thinking a lot about social networks, machine learning and applying mathematical models to social data. At Intridea, he’s responsible for researching and developing emerging web technologies, launching new products and coding. Recently, he’s been checking out Erlang & XMPP and has been spending lots of time hacking away deep in the guts of the Rails framework. </p>

RubyNation is pleased to confirm Ben Scofield, development director at Viget Labs, speaking on "Comics is Hard: Domain Modeling Challenges".

<p>
"It sometimes seems like all domains easily map onto relational database like MySQL and Postgres — that we live in a happy land where all Employees are People, and all People are Mammals. Unfortunately, however, there are many domains that just don't map so easily onto a standard relational schema. In this session, we'll look at three general alternatives to the familiar model, as illustrated by some specific examples."

<p>
At Viget Labs, Ben builds Rails applications for Web 2.0 startups. He’s been using Ruby and Rails for over four years, and is the author of Practical REST on Rails 2 Projects, from Apress. He’s spoken at Railsconf, Rubyconf, Railsconf Europe, and more over the past few years. When he’s not hacking, he spends time with his wife and daughter, reads voraciously, and tries to make the world a better place for web developers everywhere.  Ben blogs at <a href="http://www.culann.com/">www.culann.com</a> and <a href="http://www.viget.com/extend/">www.viget.com/extend</a>.</p>
