    <h2>RubyNation Organizers</h2>

    <p>The Washington DC metropolitan area has one of the largest and most
        active Ruby communities in the United States.

The RubyNation Conference is staffed by

        membership of the Northern Virginia Ruby Users Group (<a
        href="http://www.novarug.org">NovaRUG</a>).</p>

    <h3>The List</h3>

    <p>Our organizers are unpaid volunteers who have selflessly devoted a
        significant amount of their time and effort to make this high-quality
        regional conference a reality.</p>

    <h3>Contributors</h3>
  
    <ul class="people">
      <li><strong>Chad Fowler</strong> - A well-known writer, consultant,
          trainer and speaker in the Ruby community.  He is the author of
          <em>Rails Recipes</em>, an influential and widely read technical book.

          href="http://www.chadfowler.com/2007/3/26/how-to-run-a-small-conference">blog
          entry</a> on conference organization was a major influence on the
          formation of the RubyNation Conference.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Jim Freeze</strong> - The Chief Organizer of the <a
          href="http://www.lonestarrubyconf.com/">Lone Star Ruby Conference</a>,
          an annual regional conference held in Austin, Texas. Jim Freeze

          quality conference.</li>

      <li><strong>Rich Kilmer</strong> - A nationally known Ruby 
          advocate from our local Ruby community.

          and co-founder of both the NovaRUG and this conference.

          form the community to the point to where the RubyNation conference
          could be successful.</li>
