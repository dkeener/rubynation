    <p>
RubyNation Keynote speaker Chad Fowler explains how you can 
become "The Passionate Programmer".
</p>

<p>
What should the career path of a programmer be? How do you know what
you're aiming for? What defines success?
</p>

<p>
Many of us started out assuming the answers to these questions
included slowly climbing a corporate promotion structure,
ultimately becoming a people or project manager and no longer a programmer.
</p>

<p>
But we didn't get into software development so we could fill out
spreadsheets and attend status meetings. We got into software
development because we were excited about it. We wanted to be creative
and to build great things.
</p>

<p>
From the author of The Passionate Programmer, this session will walk
through how a software developer can not only succeed but
work toward building a remarkable career. We'll draw examples from
business, the arts, music, and sports. By the end of the
presentation, we will have laid out a structured framework for
radically succeeding in the software industry.

    <h2>Featured Rails Presentation:  Yehuda Katz</h2>

    <img alt="Yehuda Katz" class="person-pic" height="140" src="/archive/2009/images/speakers/yehuda_katz.jpg?1244846293" width="140" />

    <p>
Yehuda Katz presents "From Rails to Rack: Making Rails 3 a Better Ruby Citizen".
</p>

<p>
Rails 3 is on its way, and Yehuda Katz is giving RubyNation a sneak peek! With the advent of the Rack spec and library, Ruby web frameworks can interact in unprecedented ways. 
Imagine a Rails application routing to a Sinatra application, or Merb-style exception pages that catch exceptions from Rails or Cloudkit. 
</p>

<p>
The idea is simple: create a tiny API for interaction between elements of a web application. 
Instead of requiring special mechanisms for tests, controller instantiation, or CSRF forgery protection, design apps as a collection of such elements strung together into a stack. 
As with Unix pipes, limiting the interaction between elements makes powerful combinations a snap.
</p>

<p>
Merb 0.9 was rebuilt from the ground up to take advantage of Rack, and Rails has begun incorporating it as well. 
Rails 3 will make Rack a fundamental part of the framework.
</p>

<p>
Join Yehuda and talk about how this powerful idea is influencing the next generation of Rails, and how it will change the way you develop.
</p>

<p>
Yehuda Katz works full time at Engine Yard as a Core Team Member on the Rails and Merb projects. 
He is the co-author of <em>jQuery in Action</em> and the upcoming <em>Merb in Action</em>, and is a contributor to <em>Ruby in Practice</em>. 
He spends most of his time hacking on Rails and Merb, but also on other Ruby community projects, like Rubinius and Datamapper. 
And when the solution doesn't yet exist, he'll try his hand at creating one - as such, he's also created projects like Thor and DO.rb.

    <p>
David A. Black presents "Preparing for Ruby 1.9".
</p>

<p>
With the release of Ruby 1.9.1 in January, the 1.9 series has really come into its own. 
There are a lot of new features, as well as some snags for anyone migrating code from 1.8. 
In this presentation, we'll look at a bit of both: what's new in 1.9 (encoding, the full maturity of enumerators, sorted hashes, and more) and some of the things you need to be aware of as you update your existing code (no more "each" for strings, the remove of the default to_a, etc.) 
The talk will give you your bearings in 1.9, preparing you to get the most out of the language and helping you to follow the on-going debates and discussions about the further development of Ruby.
</p>

    <p>"Workflow" is a generic concept that can mean different things to 
	different people – a book author is going to think of workflow a lot 
	differently than a photographer processing images. Whether you are 
	implementing a simple shopping cart or building a complex system to 
	track the review of legal documents, there are abstract concepts of 
	states, transitions, actions, actors, assignments, tasking, concurrency,
	sequences, and dependencies we can use.</p>

    <p>Come learn about tools and techniques for implementing workflow 
	concepts in Ruby and Rails. From user stories with `shoulda', through 
	state machines, to complete workflow engines like OpenWFEru, this is

    <p>
Luc Castera presents "Distributed Computing with Ruby and TupleSpaces".
</p>

<p>
Ruby threads are limited due to the Global Interpreter Lock. Therefore, the best way to do parallel computing with Ruby is to use multiple processes but how do you get these processes to communicate?
</p>

<p>
This session will provide some strategies for handling multi-process communication in Ruby, with a focus on the use of TupleSpaces. A TupleSpace provides a repository of tuples that can be accessed concurrently to implement a Blackboard system. Ruby ships with a built-in implementation of a TupleSpace with the Rinda library.
</p>

<p>
During the session, Luc will demonstrate how to use Rinda and will highlight other libraries/projects that facilitate interprocess communication and parallel computing in Ruby.

Mark Cornick presents "Code Stinkers Anonymous: Learning To Write Better Code And Love Refactoring".
</p>

<p>
As a professional developer, especially one who works in Ruby, you hear about code quality all the time. You learn that testing your code and making it easy to maintain are the path to success. You know about TDD, BDD, TATFT and LMNOP. You learn to cycle from red to green to refactoring. We all do our best to write quality, maintainable, reusable code. We're all human, though; some of us slip, and some of us have had to work hard at preventing code smells. In this talk, I'll talk about how I learned to program, how going pro exposed flaws in my coding style, and how I'm working to improve my code quality, sharing some of my old stinky code, the better, refactored versions, and the lessons I've learned in honing my craft. 
</p>

<p>
Mark Cornick is a web developer and systems administrator at Viget Labs in Falls Church, Virginia. He spent the first ten years of his career doing sysadmin work, until he learned Ruby and Rails as a way to stay busy during a layoff.

    <p>
David Eisinger presents "Optimizing Perceived Performance".
</p>

<p>
As Phil Karlton said, “there are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.” Despite enormous advances in the field of web development over the last five years, it remains difficult to use caching to allow sites to scale for expanding user bases. Fortunately, the last few years have also seen the rise of JavaScript libraries that take a lot of the pain out of client-side programming. In this talk, we’ll explore techniques for making your sites feel faster, without resorting to complicated caching schemes, while maintaining strict separation of content, style, and behavior.
</p>

<p>
Using a sample Rails app, we'll look at client side code to do the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Reduce initial load time
</li>
<li>
Render content inline via AJAX
</li>
<li>
Increase responsiveness
</li>
<li>
Background-load content
</li>
<li>
Isolate bottlenecks
</li>
<li>
Eliminate blocking operations
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The goal is that the talk will serve three purposes: to explain some of the psychology behind user impressions of website performance, to introduce unobtrusive javascript to the uninitiated, and to describe some novel techniques to more experienced web developers.
</p>

    <p>
Pradeep Elankumaran presents "Fast and Scalable Front/Back-end Services using Ruby, Rails and XMPP"
</p>

    <p>
The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a set of open standards for real-time presence and communication. Apart from powering high-traffic instant messaging systems, XMPP can also be used to write cutting-edge real-time web applications using Ruby web frameworks. This session will provide a high-level overview of the XMPP protocol and various scalable front-end and back-end messaging architectures including message queuing and publish/subscribe that will help offload many of your app's expensive operations. There will also be a comparison of various XMPP servers and an introduction to Ruby libraries that help interface your framework with XMPP. Finally, there will be a discussion about front-end browser interfaces that use XMPP via Javascript and the BOSH protocol to provide lightning-quick and elegant user interfaces. Attendees will walk away with a thorough understanding of what it takes to modify existing web applications to include XMPP solutions for backend messaging or to create full-blown XMPP applications from scratch using Ruby.
</p>

    <p>
A former computational scientist, Pradeep was writing astrophysical simulations in Ruby well before the language became fashionable. Since then, he has been working with and thinking a lot about social networks, machine learning and applying mathematical models to social data. At Intridea, he’s responsible for researching and developing emerging web technologies, launching new products and coding. Recently, he’s been checking out Erlang & XMPP and has been spending lots of time hacking away deep in the guts of the Rails framework.

(methods that end in a question mark, and underscores), to larger
issues such as IOC containers and AOP programming. This talk is
designed to dig into some of the deeper mental disconnect that many
developers have when coming over to the Rails world.

    Ask most Ruby or Groovy programmers and they will
    tell you that design patterns are among the things they
    are trying to leave behind. Design patterns are clearly a
    part of the old world of heavy weight processes and
    overblown designs that just doesn't work. Or are they?
    In this talk, Russ Olsen takes a fresh look at the original ideas
    behind design patterns to see how they fit with more
    the more flexible, dynamic languages of today.

Russ Olsen's career spans almost three decades, during which he
has written graphics device drivers, geographic information

    <p>
Tony Pitale presents "'Handling' Legacy Databases with Rails and DataMapper".
</p>

    <p>
DataMapper has pushed the Ruby ORM market to new heights of speed (through laziness), strength (through separation), and flexibility (through mapping). At this time the rails_datamapper plugin is the way to bring DM and Rails together. Soon, the Merb/Rails merger will lead to seamless inter-operability between DM and Rails.
</p>

    <p>
In the coming years we can only expect to deal with more and more legacy databases, whether they come from the corporate Java projects or from aging PHP web applications.
</p>

    <p>
The goal of this session is to provide some strategies for “handling” legacy databases, for whatever that means to a project. Whether it be using the database as is, wrapping it nicely, or simply migrating into a better designed and built database. We’ll begin by covering the basics of setting up DM in Rails. We’ll quickly move on to cover, at the very least, overriding keys of varying types, non-standard table naming, connecting to multiple databases for the purpose of syncing or migrating data, and a variety of association examples. If time permits we’ll discuss methods of addressing constraints, triggers, views, and database functions.
</p>

    <p>
Tony Pitale is a developer at Viget Labs, where he builds Rails applications for startups and conventional businesses. He’s been developing with Ruby for nearly 3 years and has built web applications with Rails, Merb, and DataMapper. When not developing he spends time with his girlfriend, dog, and family, as well as reading, writing, cycling, and playing jazz music.

"It sometimes seems like all domains easily map onto relational database like MySQL and Postgres — that we live in a happy land where all Employees are People, and all People are Mammals. Unfortunately, however, there are many domains that just don't map so easily onto a standard relational schema. In this session, we'll look at three general alternatives to the familiar model, as illustrated by some specific examples."

The RubyNation wants to hear your <b>lightning talk!</b>
Whatever you want to talk, rave, or rant about, this is your chance.
We don't care what it is, just as long as it is of interest to the 
Ruby community and relatively short (like 10 minutes max). 
Your lightning talk can be fun, like "<em>X</em> is awesome! It changed me as a person!", 
a call to arms, like "Help us build <em>Y</em>. The world needs it!", 
a plea, like "Let's put an end to the scourge of <em>Z</em>.".
You've heard of opinionated software, well this is opinionated talking.
So, let's hear yours.
Oh, and please keep it no worse than PG-13 rated.
