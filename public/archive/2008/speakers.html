    <h2>RubyNation Keynote Speakers</h2>

    <h3><a name="neal_ford">Neal Ford</a>, Opening Keynote:  Ceremony vs.  Essence</h3>
    <img alt="Neal_ford" class="person-pic" src="/archive/2008/images/speakers/neal_ford.jpg?1210757290" />
    
    <p>Neal explained why the debate between static vs. dynamic languages
        is really a red herring, that the debate should be about Essence vs. Ceremony.
        Neal's keynote will illustrate the origins of these concepts, what they mean to 
        modern software development, and why everyone is suddenly interested in dynamic 
        languages like Ruby.</p>
      
    <p><em>Neil is a Software Architect and Meme Wrangler at
        ThoughtWorks, a global IT consultancy with an exclusive focus on
        end-to-end software development and delivery. Neil is an internationally
        acclaimed speaker, speaking at over 100 developer conferences worldwide,
        delivering more than 600 talks.  Neil blogs at 
        <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/">Meme Agora</a>,
        where he writes about Ruby and many other topics.</em></p>

    <h3><a name="giles_bowkett">Giles Bowkett, Afternoon Keynote: Archaeopteryx: A Ruby MIDI Generator</a></h3>
    <img alt="Giles_bowkett" class="person-pic" src="/archive/2008/images/speakers/giles_bowkett.jpg?1211495566" />
    <p>
       Giles will present his now-famous presentation 
       "Archaeopteryx: A Ruby MIDI Generator", at this year's RubyNation.
       MIDI is a data protocol for music. Archaeopteryx generates MIDI via
       Ruby to drive prosumer studio music software. It can generate
       hyperkinetic DJ mixes, infinite streams of ambient music for
       meditation, and original drum and bass rhythms.
    </p>
    <p>
       Archaeopteryx is a new project undergoing development. Archaeopteryx
       uses procs extensively, and benefits from an approach to Ruby informed
       by Lisp and higher-order programming. Arkx (the project's nickname)
       contains a Lispy approach to the classic Gang Of Four Strategy pattern
       which has to be the simplest, most powerful expression of the Strategy
       pattern in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
       Informed by 37 Signals' "Getting Real," the investment strategy of a
       top venture capital firm, and the careers of prominent Rubyists,
       Archaeopteryx presents a bold, defiant approach to business models for
       programming, in the context of very powerful coding idioms.
    </p>
    <p><em>
       Since discovering Rails in 2005, Giles has built many Rails
       apps, including <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a>, 
       which sees more traffic than Twitter. His presentation on Archaeopteryx at 
       <a href="http://2008.goruco.com/">GoRuCo</a>
       in New York this April was the
       highest-rated presentation there. Jeremy McAnnally described his
       MountainWest RubyConf presentation as "brain-meltingly awesome." His
       <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/">blog</a> 
       often shows up on Reddit, Digg, and Hacker News. In his past
       lives he was a Perl guru, a Java hacker, a rave promoter, and an art
       student.</em></p>

    <h3><a name="stuart_halloway">Stuart Halloway</a>, Closing Keynote: Bad Ruby</h3>
    <img alt="Stuart_halloway" class="person-pic" src="/archive/2008/images/speakers/stuart_halloway.jpg?1215099022" />

    <p>
Ruby's dynamic features make it easy to write low-ceremony code. Unlike many languages today, Ruby allows you to

override calls to new, generate new classes and methods at runtime,
evaluate code on-the-fly, dynamically respond to methods with
method_missing, create headerless source code files, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
But you should not be satisfied with these. 
Ruby's abstractions are neither as rich, nor as composable, as they could be. 
In this talk, we will look at what's wrong with Ruby. 
Issues include unnecessary language features such as class variables,
syntax variations that require you to overspecify (e.g. instance
variables), limitations of Ruby reflection, second-class citizens, such as
blocks.
And, of course, we will show specific, 
real-world examples where these limitations lead to unmaintainable, legacy code.
    </p>

    <p>
Avoid these pitfalls, and your Ruby code will be more maintainable. And you will develop a keen sense of what to look for in Ruby's successor.

    <h2>RubyNation Speakers</h2>

    <h3><a name="david_bock">David Bock</a></h3>
    <img alt="Dave_bock" class="person-pic" src="/archive/2008/images/speakers/dave_bock.jpg?1211495566" />
      
    <p>
       David will present "Tools for your Ruby Toolbox".  
       Rails may be the framework that turned many of us on to Ruby, 
       but if you are using it for all of your server-related Ruby projects, 
       you probably have a hammer and are seeing every problem as a nail.  
       There are a number of smaller, tighter solutions to problem in this space, 
       including GServer (built into the Ruby libraries), 
       StaticMatic (a tool for generating a static site, but with all the templating goodness), 
       and Sinatra, a small server with an awesome DSL for restful web services.  
       We will spend a little bit of time of each of these, 
       seeing how you can use each for a project where you might have previously considered Rails.
    </p>

    <h3>Yehuda Katz</h3>
    <img alt="Yehuda_katz" class="person-pic" src="/archive/2008/images/speakers/yehuda_katz.jpg?1211495566" />
    <p>
       Yehuda Katz will be presenting "Living on the Edge." While Ruby has a very 
     mature software stack in Rails, Test::Unit, and ActiveRecord, some very 
     interesting developments are happening on the Ruby edge. Merb has grown up 
     as a replacement for Ruby on Rails, DataMapper is becoming a viable, 
     enhanced ActiveRecord, and even the venerable rdoc has competition with 
     YARDoc. Unfortunately, living on the Ruby edge can be fraught with peril, 
     as combining unreleased gems from version control can require a more 
     intimate knowledge of Ruby than we are typically used to.</p>
   <p>
     Yehuda will walk you through some of the most exciting advances on the 
     frontiers of Ruby, and provide a tour guide to those who want to walk the 
     dangerous path. By the time the talk is over, you should feel comfortable 
     downloading a bleeding-edge git-repository and installing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      David Keener will present "Practical JRuby".
This talk provides a number of step-by-step examples
that illustrate different ways in which Rails
applications can interact effectively with a
third-party Java libraries. The presentation will show
how developers can leverage JRuby to augment Rails
applications with the mature, third-party libraries
that are widely available in the Java world.

    <h3>Russ Olsen</h3>
    <img alt="Russ_olsen" class="person-pic" src="/archive/2008/images/speakers/russ_olsen.jpg?1212685949" />
    <p>  
       Russ Olsen will be presenting "DSLs and Ruby: Blurring the Lines Between 
     Programs And Data". Domain specific languages have played a key role in 
     Ruby's explosive growth. In fact, much of the vital infrastructure of the 
     Ruby world, software like Rake and RSpec and, of course, Rails, is built 
     around a DSL of one kind or another.
    </p>
    <p>
       In this talk, Russ will look at when a DSL is appropriate and when you should 
     stick to a more traditional approach. He will also discuss the different kinds 
     of DSLs and will also present a number of practical techniques for making the 
     leap from a well designed API to a real DSL. Along the way he will point out 
     some of the technical holes that you can fall down while building your DSL.
    </p>
  <p><em>Russ Olsen is a software engineer, trainer and public speaker with a
    background in Java, Ruby and Rails. He is the author of "Design Patterns

    <p>
      Glenn Vanderburg will
      present 'The Culture of Innovation in Ruby'.  The Ruby community is
      a wellspring of innovation at the moment; many people are doing
      fascinating new things with tools, libraries, and exploring new ways to
      use the language.  This talk will explore some of the reasons for that
      innovative culture, and discuss ways we can benefit from it and keep it
      healthy.

    <p>
Michael's <em>Ruby Puzzlers</em> cover Ruby language related pitfalls 
with examples showing how bugs can hide in innocent looking code.  
As part of Michael's research, he discovered quite a few abnormalities that are not mentioned
