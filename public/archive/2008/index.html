    <h2>RubyNation Photos!</h2>

    <p>
    As you can see from the photos, RubyNation was fantastic!  
    The other organizers and I are
    really excited to have pulled off a great event for the DC area. 
    You can bet that we will be back next year, bigger and better!
    </p>

    <p>
    We had over one hundred organizations represented at RubyNation this year.
    The mix of Ruby perspectives brought together for a couple of great
    days was well worth the risk and effort of putting this on.
    Thanks again to our wonderful speakers, our sponsors (buy their
    products, their services, or go to work for them, folks!), to the CIT
    facilities and food staff, to those who
    helped me organize the conference, and most of all
    thank you to everyone who attended.

    <h2>More Extra Speaker News</h2>

    <img alt="Bryan_liles" class="person-pic" src="/archive/2008/images/speakers/bryan_liles.jpg?1232518342" />

    <p>
    Now that Michael Furr is no longer a backup speaker, 
    we have a new "extra" speaker to announce. 
    Bryan Liles has offered to take on that role.  Bryan's talk is 
    "Developer Horticulture 101:  The feeding and care of software developers".  
    In this talk, Bryan will explore the challenges and successes involved with 
    helping developers grow their talents and their careers.
    Bryan's bio and a description of his talk has been added to the speakers page.
    </p>

    <p>
    Bryan Liles practices polyglot programming at Sourcefire, the Snort company, 
    in Columbia, MD.  Bryan can be found online at 
    <a href="http://smartic.us">http://smartic.us</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <em>
      Editor's Note: Ok, I admit I posted this way after July 30th.  I
      just realized to my horror that I never posted anything about the
      Bryan helping us out with the backup speaker situation.  As it
      turned out, he did not just one talk, but two (during
      the lightning talk times of both days) and he stole the show with both!

    <h2><em>Extra</em> Speaker Michael Furr Announced</h2>

    <img alt="Mike_furr" class="person-pic" src="/archive/2008/images/speakers/mike_furr.jpg?1218732707" />
    <p>
    We are pleased to announce the addition of Michael Furr as an <em>extra</em> speaker.
    Michael will act as an official backup speaker and will have his
    <em>Ruby Puzzlers</em> presentation available should the need arise.
    Regardless, however, Michael has offered to present at least a few of his
    puzzlers during the lightning talk sessions.
    </p>

    <p>
Michael's <em>Ruby Puzzlers</em> cover Ruby language related pitfalls 
with examples showing how bugs can hide in innocent looking code.  
As part of Michael's research, he discovered quite a few abnormalities that are not mentioned 
by most of the Ruby documentation (online APIs, the Pickaxe book, etc...).  
This talk presents various syntactic and semantic corner cases in the language 
that most people might not be familiar with.
    </p>

    <p>
    Micheal is a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland where he is
    researching Ruby, specifically producing Diamondback Ruby (DRuby), 
    a tool that aims to introduce static typing to Ruby.
    DRuby is an analysis framework for Ruby that includes most parts of a compiler front end, 
    from a GLR parser up to the semantic passes over the code for typing and other analyses.

Rely on Engine Yard: 70 people, two data centers, and four continents.
      </p>

      <p>
Engine Yard came about in early 2006 because we saw a genuine need: customers were developing business-critical Rails apps, but they didn't want to worry about deployment issues, nor did they want to hire IT staff to manage servers.  Instead, customers wanted Rails-focused 24/7 operations support, great infrastructure, and a smooth path from one to one million users.
      </p>

      <p>
We handle deployment and maintenance, so you can focus on building your application and running your business.
Our deep roots in the Ruby and Rails communities, combined with our commitment to driving the next generation of Ruby technologies, offer our customers the peace of mind of knowing their applications are managed by a team of true technical experts.

      or "Design Patterns in Ruby", to our outstanding speaker lineup.  Russ
      will present "DSLs and Ruby: Blurring the Lines Between Programs And

      explosive growth.  In fact, much of the vital infrastructure of the Ruby
      world, software like Rake and RSpec and, of course, Rails, is built around
      a DSL of one kind or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk, Russ will look at when a DSL is appropriate and when you
      should stick to a more traditional approach. He will also discuss the
      different kinds of DSLs and will also present a number of practical
      techniques for making the leap from a well designed API to a real DSL.
      Along the way he will point out some of the technical holes that you can

    <p>
      RubyNation is pleased to announce that Yehuda Katz will be presenting
      "Living on the Edge".  While Ruby has a very mature software stack in
      Rails, Test::Unit, and ActiveRecord, some very interesting developments
      are happening on the Ruby edge. Merb has grown up as a replacement to Ruby
      on Rails, DataMapper is becoming a viable, enhanced ActiveRecord, and even
      the venerable rdoc has competition with YARDoc. Unfortunately, living on
      the Ruby edge can be fraught with peril, as combining unreleased gems from
      version control can require a more intimate knowledge of Ruby than we are
      typically used to. Yehuda will walk you through some of the most exciting
      advances on the frontiers of Ruby, and provide a tour guide to those who
      want to walk the dangerous path. By the time the talk is over, you should
      feel comfortable downloading a bleeding-edge git-repository and installing
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yehuda Katz is the author of jQuery in Action, and is a core team member
      of the jQuery project. He contributes heavily to DataMapper project, is
      the creator of the DO.rb project, as well as SalesforceMapper, a
      DataMapper adapter for Salesforce. He is a contributor to Merb, an
      up-and-coming MVC framework written in Ruby, and is a contributing author
      for the upcoming Manning Publications book Ruby in Practice. He has been
      working with Ruby on Rails and jQuery since 2005, and is currently taking
      the lead on the internal control panel for Engine Yard, while helping
      maintain Merb.

      and was an early adopter and proponent of Ruby, Rails, and agile
      practices.

    <h2>Speaker Giles Bowkett Announced</h2>
    <img alt="Giles_bowkett" class="person-pic" src="/archive/2008/images/speakers/giles_bowkett.jpg?1211495566" />
    <p>
      We are thrilled to announce that Giles Bowkett will present his now-famous
      presentation 'Archaeopteryx: A Ruby MIDI Generator', at this year's
      RubyNation.  MIDI is a data protocol for music. Archaeopteryx generates
      MIDI via Ruby to drive prosumer studio music software. It can generate
      hyperkinetic DJ mixes, infinite streams of ambient music for meditation,
      and original drum and bass rhythms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archaeopteryx is a new project undergoing development. Archaeopteryx uses
      procs extensively, and benefits from an approach to Ruby informed by Lisp
      and higher-order programming. Arkx (the project's nickname) contains a
      Lispy approach to the classic Gang Of Four Strategy pattern which has to
      be the simplest, most powerful expression of the Strategy pattern in
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Informed by 37 Signals' "Getting Real," the investment strategy of a top
      venture capital firm, and the careers of prominent Rubyists, Archaeopteryx
      presents a bold, defiant approach to business models for programming, in
      the context of very powerful coding idioms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since discovering Rails in 2005, Giles has built many Rails apps,
      including Hulu, which sees more traffic than Twitter. His presentation on
      Archaeopteryx at GoRuCo in New York this April was the highest-rated
      presentation there. Jeremy McAnnally described his MountainWest RubyConf
      presentation as "brain-meltingly awesome." His blog often shows up on
      Reddit, Digg, and Hacker News. In his past lives he was a Perl guru, a
      Java hacker, a rave promoter, and an art student.

    <h2>Speaker David Bock Announced</h2>
    <img alt="Dave_bock" class="person-pic" src="/archive/2008/images/speakers/dave_bock.jpg?1211495566" />
    <p>
      RubyNation is proud to announce David Bock as a speaker.  David is a
      Principal Consultant at <a href="http://www.codesherpas.com/">Code Sherpas</a>, a consultancy
      specializing in Java and Ruby software development.  He is also the
      President of the Northern Virginia Java Users Group, the Editor of
      O'Reilly's OnJava.com website, and a frequent speaker on technology in
      venues such as the No Fluff Just Stuff Software Symposiums.  David donned
      the Ruby slippers in 2005.
    </p>
    <p>
      David will present 'Tools for your Ruby Toolbox'.  Rails may be the
      framework that turned many of us on to Ruby, but if you are using it for
      all of your server-related ruby projects, you probably have a hammer and
      are seeing every problem as a nail.  There are a number of smaller,
      tighter solutions to problems in this space, including GServer (built into
      the ruby libraries), StaticMatic (a tool for generating a static site, but
      with all the templating goodness), and Sinatra, a small server with an
      awesome DSL for restful web services.  We will spend a little bit of time
      of each of these, seeing how you can use each for a project where you
      might have previously considered Rails.

    <h2>Keynote Speaker Neal Ford Announced</h2>
    <img alt="Neal_ford" class="person-pic" src="/archive/2008/images/speakers/neal_ford.jpg?1210757290" />
    <p>
      RubyNation is proud to announce Neal Ford as our opening keynote speaker.
      Neil is a Software Architect and Meme Wrangler at ThoughtWorks, a global
      IT consultancy with an exclusive focus on end-to-end software development
      and delivery. Neil is an internationally acclaimed speaker, speaking at
      over 100 developer conferences worldwide, delivering more than 600 talks.
      Neil blogs at <a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/"> Meme Agora</a>,
      where he writes about Ruby and many other topics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Neal will explain why the debate between static vs. dynamic languages is
      really a red herring, that the debate should be about Essence vs.
      Ceremony.  Neal's keynote will illustrate the origins of these concepts,
      what they mean to modern software development, and why everyone is
      interested in dynamic languages like Ruby all of a sudden.
