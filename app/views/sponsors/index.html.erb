      <p>
      SHOUTREEL is a simple and easy application that lets users create
      micro-forums about anything.  These micro-forums are called Reels, they can
      be public or private.  The ultimate goal of SHOUTREEL is to create embedable
      forums that are lite and nimble, which can be embedded into other platforms
      such as: mobile devices, social networks, and blogs/websites.
      </p>

      <p>
      One very distiguishing aspect of SHOUTREEL is that users don't need to
      register or login to participate in public Reels.  The user is able to shout
      and express anonymously.  Reels that are private require a key or
      membership.
      </p>

      <p>
      SHOUTREEL is built with all open source Ruby technology: Rails, Phusion
      Passenger, Enterprise Ruby, geokit, rmagick, paperclip, thinking-sphinx, and
      many more.
